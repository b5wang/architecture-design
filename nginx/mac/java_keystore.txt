# Now we have ssl certificate:
- server.crt = certificate
- server.csr = certificate signing request
- server.key = private key

# what is .pem and .crt?
SSL certificate mainly has PEM and DER, 2 formats which are defined by public key standard X.509.
PEM(Privacy Enhanced Mail) is based on Base64 format, extensions include PEM, CRT, and CER. Linux OS uses CRT, windows OS uses CER.
如果你有证书，.crt，它的格式可能是PEM，或者DER.
DER is a binary format described by ASN.1

# how to check the crt, cer format is pem or der?
## For pem,
> openssl x509 -in server.crt -text -noout
or
> openssl x509 -in server.crt -inform pem -text -noout
If it is not pem, it will get,
unable to load certificate
12626:error:0906D06C:PEM routines:PEM_read_bio:no start line:pem_lib.c:647:Expecting: TRUSTED CERTIFICATE View DER encoded Certificate
## For der,
openssl x509 -in server.crt -inform der -text -noout

> openssl help
To get more operations
## pem and der, two formats can convert from each others.

# How to import certificate and private key into java keystore?
Public key encryption standard PKCS has PKCS#7, PKCS#12, JKS (Java specific)
##1. Merge certificate and private key into .pfx
> openssl pkcs12 -export -in server.crt -inkey server.key -out server.p12
-- Enter export password: 123456 ****** It is very necessary, when run keystool need it 
> keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore server.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -deststoretype JKS -destkeystore server.jks
Enter destination keystore password:  
Re-enter new password: 123456 
Enter source keystore password: 123456 
Entry for alias 1 successfully imported.
Import command completed:  1 entries successfully imported, 0 entries failed or cancelled

Warning:
The JKS keystore uses a proprietary format. It is recommended to migrate to PKCS12 which is an industry standard format using "keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore server.jks -destkeystore server.jks -deststoretype pkcs12".
